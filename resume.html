					<p class="sub-heading">UX Designer & Developer @The Healing Chair</p>
					<p class="duration">JAN 2017 - </p>
					<p>The Healing Chair is a non-profit, breast cancer charity that is located in the Kansas City metro area, along with multiple locations spread throughout the midwest. While under their employment, I was tasked with doing an entire site re-design. I developed multiple wireframes, mock-ups, style tiles and functional prototypes of their new site. Given that the site was built with wix, some forms of functionality were limited, but wix was the prefered CMS from the client. I was able to install plugins that let me inject some of my own Css and Javascript code into the site that allowed for various effects. The final configuration of the site is listed as "Healing Chair Official Website" under the projects page. </p>

                    <p class="sub-heading">IT & Technical Maintenance @ Traftec inc.</p>
					<p class="duration">AUG 2015 - NOV 2016 </p>
                    <p>Even though I'm not COMPTIA certified, I was hired by Traftec part-time to routinely maintain their various machines in the offices. My tasks would range from simple things like IOS updates for employee's phones, to building new PC's and installing the latest version of windows on them. I was there to assist all of the employees with all of their technical related problems and made sure that both their cell phones and computers were working optimally. I was also in charge of data management with creating share-folders for the company to make sure that everyone could access what they needed. While these skills in particular don't directly pertain to web-development, it shows that I am able to ensure that both my equipment and the equipment of my peers will not malfunction during the development process.</p>
