				<h3>Where can I purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan?</h3>
				<p>Depending on the Apple product, the AppleCare Protection Plan is available at the Apple Online Store, Apple retail stores and many Apple Authorised Resellers, including many wireless service providers. Apple recommends that you purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan in your country of residence, because each AppleCare Protection Plan has terms and conditions specific to consumers of the country or region in which the plan is offered.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>What service options does the AppleCare Protection Plan offer?</h3>
				<p>The AppleCare Protection Plan for Mac and iPod provide global repair coverage. If you take your Apple hardware with you when you travel and happen to need repair service, you can either go to an Apple Retail Store or contact Apple for information on how to obtain service. Service will be limited to the options available in the country where service is requested. Service options, parts availability and response time vary according to country. Please see the AppleCare Protection Plan Terms and Conditions for complete details.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>What kinds of parts does the AppleCare Protection Plan use for repair?</h3>
				<p>The AppleCare Protection Plan uses genuine Apple parts for repair service. Genuine Apple parts may be new or equivalent to new in both performance and reliability. Repairs are performed by Apple-authorised technicians.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Is the AppleCare Protection Plan transferable?</h3>

				<h3>When I purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan, do I need to register it?</h3>
				<p>If you purchase the AppleCare Protection Plan at the same time as your Mac, iPhone, iPod, Apple TV or Apple display from the Apple Online Store or the Apple Retail Store, Apple will register the AppleCare Protection Plan for you. If you purchase your AppleCare Protection Plan and your covered product separately or elsewhere, you will need to register your AppleCare Protection Plan.</p>
				<p>Your AppleCare Protection Plan coverage starts from your hardware purchase date. Registering your AppleCare Protection Plan at a later date does not extend your coverage. In fact, there are many benefits to registering your AppleCare Protection Plan as soon as you purchase it.</p>
				<p>For example, after you register, Apple will have your hardware, AppleCare Protection Plan and personal contact information on file. When you contact Apple for service or support, Apple can access your information right away and start addressing your issue, rather than spending time verifying your eligibility.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
