					<p>My full name is Tyler Austin-Garcia McGinnis, I was born and raised in Kansas City for 21 years. 
                        <br></br>

                        I attended Johnson County Community College in Overland Park KS, where I studied Web Development and Digital Media, Programming and written Journalism. While there, I learned extensive techniques in web-based interface design, structuring, prototyping, debugging, implementation and management of web sites. Along with building the structure and functionality, I was taught how to develop content for the sites that I was producing. I learned photo manipulation, fundementals of photography and cinematagrophy, and video editting all by using adobe products.
                        <br></br>

                        Along with front end development, I was taught extensively about workflow and managing projects both by myself and with a team. I learned to use both the Waterfall workflow and Agile workflow methodologies. I also learned about problem solving techniques that could be applied both into the technical field and on a professional level. I am a firm believer in team cooperation and will strive to make sure that whoever I am working with will be doing so at their full potential when they are fully able to.

                        A website is only considered to be great if it is both popular and is attracting the right audience. I was taught that understanding the person you are building a site for and their audience is the key to building  a truly memorable experience. I have a firm understanding of Analytical implemenation with google analytics  by creating and managing social campaigns. I can find out which campaigns and aspects of the site added worked and didn't work. I can ensure that the site will remain both coherent and flexible to it's target audience(s).

                        <br></br>
                        Search engine optimization is a vital aspect to ensure that your site and service are found. I take pride in maticulously ensuring that a web page is optimized to it's fullest potential to maximize on potential viewers. I ensure that whatever element on a page that could be optimized, is optimized. I will not spam tags and titles, that could lead to a potential loss of customers and makes both the developer and site owner look un-professional.

					<p>What I consider to be the absolute best skill I have when it comes to the development process is, site structuring and interface development. I am well accustomed to Html and Css side development and can include some creative Css based design and interactivity. I also enjoy the wireframing process and plotting what elements will go where on a page.
                        <br></br>
                        Apart from wireframing, I also enjoy the mock-up/prototyping process. When I go to any web page that I think has potential to be better than it is; I constantly think, what happens if the nav was this wide, what if this animation had this transition etc. I am constantly thinking of fixes and extra features that a site can have and usually find myself playing with the site's code using the inspector tools.
                       
                        <br></br>
                        I have always been toying with what options various CMS platforms have to offer, I am always browsing what types of plug-ins and themes are possible for wordpress and drupal. Whether it be someone's blog or e-commerce site, I always look for what tools can be included to benefit the site's overall experience and aesthetic (without going overboard of course). While I have worked with drupal in the past, I feel most comfortable when working with the Wordpress platform.

                         Another skill that I consider myself to be proficient in is scripting interactive elements with Javascript. Whether it be simple button actions or event based animations and DOM manipulation, I will ensure that whatever script I work on/ develop, I ensure that it fit's the site's flow and offers a new layer to the overall experience of the page.
